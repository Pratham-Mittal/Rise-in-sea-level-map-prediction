# Rise-in-sea-level-map-prediction
This is simple java program which read the dataset of ETOPIO1 1 ARC-MINUTE GLOBAL RELIEF MODEL and predicts the geographic map of the world after a certain rise in sea level.

The map generated by this piece of code only shows the map after rise of 60m. If you want to change the value you need to enter that value as a parameter in sealevel in the main.java file.
